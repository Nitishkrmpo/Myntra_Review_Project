### MYNTRA SCAPPER PROJECT
## Overview
The Myntra Scrapper Project is a tool designed to scrape product data from the Myntra website. It extracts information such as product names, prices, descriptions, and images, and stores them in a structured format for further analysis.

## Features
- Scrapes product details including name, price, description, and image URL.
- Supports pagination to scrape multiple pages of products.
- Saves scraped data in CSV or JSON format.
- Configurable to scrape different categories or search results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myntra-scrapper.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd myntra-scrapper
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the scraper with the following command:
    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    ```
2. The scraped data will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Configuration
- You can configure the
 `config.json` file to specify the categories or search terms you want to scrape. Here is an example configuration:

    ```json
    {
        "base_url": "https://www.myntra.com",
        "categories": ["men-tshirts", "women-dresses"],
        "output_format": "csv",
        "pagination_limit": 5
    }
    ```

- Adjust the `base_url` if needed.
- Specify the categories you want to scrape in the `categories` list.
- Set the `output_format` to either `csv` or `json`.
- Define the `pagination_limit` to control the number of pages to scrape for each category.
